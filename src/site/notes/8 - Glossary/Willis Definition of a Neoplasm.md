# Willis Definition of a Neoplasm
A neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the normal tissues and persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli which evoked the change. It is a disorder of cell growth that is triggered by a series of acquired mutations affecting a single cell and its clonal progeny, which give the neoplastic cells a survival and growth advantage that results in excessive proliferation that is independent of physiologic growth signals.
